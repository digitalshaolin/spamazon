# spamazon

A pixel-perfect clone of the Amazon homepage. It mimics the look and animation/scroll functionality of the desktop version of Amazon's homepage. I did not make it mobile responsive as the goal was to just recreate the desktop version in as pixel-perfect a way as possible to demonstrate the ability to take an existing design and write the code in order to bring that design to life.
